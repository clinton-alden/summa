	abstract = {Many watershed-scale and land surface models incorporate snowmelt modules with simplified representations of the snowpack with three or fewer layers. These modeling choices were traditionally made to reduce model complexity and computational demand while still being able to simulate large model domains. However, these simple snow layering schemes may not always simulate snow processes and the effects of climate change across a range of climatic and geographic conditions. Here we evaluate simple snow layering schemes (having two to five layers, commonly found in watershed-scale and land surface models) against a synthetic benchmark with up to 100 layers at three locations with different climate conditions using the SUMMA modeling framework. We evaluate 10 different layering configurations of two to five layers with variable thicknesses and show that the effect of the layering scheme varies with site conditions. We find that the layer configuration is more important at a cold high elevation site in the Sierra Nevada, California (∼1.4°C annual average temperature), and at a warm site in the French Alps (∼6.5°C), and less important at a site in Idaho (∼5.0°C). The top layer thickness of the simpler snow layering configurations also influences the simulated snow surface and snowpack temperatures and timing of snowmelt. Our tests showed that the five-layer model with thin layers near the surface was closest to the benchmark (median NSE = 0.99), and therefore we recommend using multiple snow layers for reliable simulations of snow accumulation and melt across a range of climates.},

Our approach, which we term the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA), formulates a general set of conservation equations, providing the flexibility to experiment with different spatial representations, different flux parameterizations, different model parameter values, and different time stepping schemes. In this paper, we introduce the general approach used in SUMMA, detailing the spatial organization and model simplifications, and how different representations of multiple physical processes can be combined within a single modeling framework. We discuss how SUMMA can be used to systematically pursue the method of multiple working hypotheses in hydrology. In particular, we discuss how SUMMA can help tackle major hydrologic modeling challenges, including defining the appropriate complexity of a model, selecting among competing flux parameterizations, representing spatial variability across a hierarchy of scales, identifying potential improvements in computational efficiency and numerical accuracy as part of the numerical solver, and improving understanding of the various sources of model uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Local observations of snow layers are used as the basis for spatial extrapolation of snow properties and for establishing a time record of snow deposition, yet significant lateral variations in layer thickness, density and microstructure are well documented. Here we examine the nature of layer heterogeneity over distances of 10– 100 000 m using data from primarily flat locations in Alaska, Antarctica and Greenland. We find that at a scale of 10 m or less, perennial snow layers on glaciers and ice sheets are more uniform and laterally continuous than seasonal layers, which, in addition to heterogeneity introduced by wind and water percolation, are also affected by local topography and vegetation. At a scale of about 100 m, heterogeneity of seasonal and perennial snow layers converges and approaches a peak value. At larger scales (103–105m), local (order 100 m) forcing continues to produce most of the layer heterogeneity, with synoptic-scale variations adding small amounts. Cross-correlation at these larger scales is based on recognizing distinctive layer sequences or matching a few key layers of snow. Many layers cannot be correlated because they pinch out or change at scales (i.e. 100 m) smaller than the spacing between snow pits.},

	abstract = {Ambiguities in the representation of environmental processes have manifested themselves in a plethora of hydrological models, differing in almost every aspect of their conceptualization and implementation. The current overabundance of models is symptomatic of an insufficient scientific understanding of environmental dynamics at the catchment scale, which can be attributed to difficulties in measuring and representing the heterogeneity encountered in natural systems. This commentary advocates using the method of multiple working hypotheses for systematic and stringent testing of model alternatives in hydrology. We discuss how the multiple-hypothesis approach provides the flexibility to formulate alternative representations (hypotheses) describing both individual processes and the overall system. When combined with incisive diagnostics to scrutinize multiple model representations against observed data, this provides hydrologists with a powerful and systematic approach for model development and improvement. Multiple-hypothesis frameworks also support a broader coverage of the model hypothesis space and hence improve the quantification of predictive uncertainty arising from system and component nonidentifiabilities. As part of discussing the advantages and limitations of multiple-hypothesis frameworks, we critically review major contemporary challenges in hydrological hypothesis-testing, including exploiting different types of data to investigate the fidelity of alternative process representations, accounting for model structure ambiguities arising from major uncertainties in environmental data, quantifying regional differences in dominant hydrological processes, and the grander challenge of understanding the self-organization and optimality principles that may functionally explain and describe the heterogeneities evident in most environmental systems. We assess recent progress in these research directions, and how new advances are possible using multiple-hypothesis methodologies.},

	abstract = {A model for calculating daily microclimate conditions in mountainous terrain is presented. Maximum–minimum daily air temperatures, precipitation, and dew point are extrapolated from valley stations to adjacent mountain slopes, after making elevation- and aspect-related corrections. The model (MT-CLIM) produces estimates of daily incoming shortwave radiation, air temperature, humidity and vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation for any mountain study site. MT-CLIM was tested against measured meteorological data on six study sites consisting of three north–south slope pairs in western Montana. Correlations between predicted and observed daily conditions on the six study sites for the period April–November 1983 were air temperature, R2 = 0.88–0.92 with standard errors {\textless}0.48 °C; relative humidity R2 = 0.63–0.72 with standard errors {\textless}15\%; radiation R2 = 0.60–0.78 with standard errors {\textless}100 W m−2. To test the utility of the model, data from MT-CLIM were used to run the DAYSTRANS/PSN model of evapotranspiration (ET) and photosynthesis (PSN) for western coniferous forests. Seasonal ET calculated from MT-CLIM data deviated by less than 5\% from ET calculated from measured meteorological conditions on the six sites. Estimates of seasonal PSN agreed to within 10\% of estimates derived from measured meteorological data on all sites except one. For each of the north–south slope study pairs, the combined MT-CLIMDAYTRANS/PSN simulation predicted that north slopes would have higher (5–31\%) seasonal PSN than the comparable south slopes, which agrees with observed patterns of forest productivity in this semiarid region.},

The exact conversion from RH to td, as well as highly accurate approximations, are too complex to be done easily without the help of a calculator or computer. However, there is a very simple rule of thumb that can be very useful for approximating the conversion for moist air (RH {\textgreater} 50\%), which does not appear to be widely known by the meteorological community: td decreases by about 1°C for every 5\% decrease in RH (starting at td= t, the dry bulb temperature, when RH = 100\%). This article examines the mathematical basis and accuracy of this and other relationships between the dewpoint and relative humidity. Several useful applications of the simple conversion are presented, in particular the computation of the cumulus cloud-base level (or lifting condensation level) as zLCL {\textgreater}{\textgreater} (20 + t/5)(100 – RH), where zLCL is in meters when t is in degrees Celcius and RH in percent. Finally, a historical perspective is given with anecdotes about some of the early work in this field.},

	abstract = {While numerous algorithms exist for predicting incident atmospheric long-wave radiation under clear (Lclr) and cloudy skies, few comparisons have been published to assess the accuracy of the different algorithms. Virtually no comparisons have been made for both clear and cloudy skies across multiple sites. This study evaluates the accuracy of 13 algorithms for predicting incident long-wave radiation under clear skies, ten cloud correction algorithms, and four algorithms for all-sky conditions using data from 21 sites across North America and China. Data from five research sites were combined with publicly available data from nine sites in the AmeriFlux network for initial evaluation and optimization of cloud cover estimates; seven additional AmeriFlux sites were used as an independent test of the algorithms. Clear-sky algorithms that excelled in predicting Lclr were the Dilley, Prata, and Ångström algorithms. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) between predicted and measured 30-minute or hourly Lclr averaged approximately 23 W m−2 for these three algorithms across all sites, while RMSD of daily estimates was as low as 14 W m−2. Cloud-correction algorithms of Kimball, Unsworth, and Crawford described the data best when combined with the Dilley clear-sky algorithm. Average RMSD across all sites for these three cloud corrections was approximately 24 to 25 W m−2 for 30-minute or hourly estimates and approximately 15 to 16 W m−2 for daily estimates. The Kimball and Unsworth cloud corrections require an estimate of cloud cover, while the Crawford algorithm corrects for cloud cover directly from measured solar radiation. Optimum limits in the clearness index, defined as the ratio of observed solar radiation to theoretical terrestrial solar radiation, for complete cloud cover and clear skies were suggested for the Kimball and Unsworth algorithms. Application of the optimized algorithms to seven independent sites yielded similar results. On the basis of the results, the recommended algorithms can be applied with reasonable accuracy for a wide range of climates, elevations, and latitudes.},

This second paper specifies the model equations and their spatial approximations, describes the hydrologic and biophysical process parameterizations currently supported within the framework, and illustrates how the framework can be used in conjunction with multivariate observations to identify model improvements and future research and data needs. The case studies illustrate the use of SUMMA to select among competing modeling approaches based on both observed data and theoretical considerations. Specific examples of preferable modeling approaches include the use of physiological methods to estimate stomatal resistance, careful specification of the shape of the within-canopy and below-canopy wind profile, explicitly accounting for dust concentrations within the snowpack, and explicitly representing distributed lateral flow processes. Results also demonstrate that changes in parameter values can make as much or more difference to the model predictions than changes in the process representation. This emphasizes that improvements in model fidelity require a sagacious choice of both process parameterizations and model parameters. In conclusion, we envisage that SUMMA can facilitate ongoing model development efforts, the diagnosis and correction of model structural errors, and improved characterization of model uncertainty.},

The authors evaluated both WRF (4/3 km) and PRISM’s (800-m annual climatology) ability to estimate frozen precipitation using the hydrologic model Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) and a unique set of spatiotemporal snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) observations collected for the Olympic Mountain Experiment (OLYMPEX) ground validation campaign during water year 2016. When SUMMA was forced with WRF precipitation and used a calibrated, wet-bulb-temperature-based method for partitioning rain versus snow, its estimation of near-peak SWE was biased low by 21\% on average. However, when SUMMA was allowed to partition WRF total precipitation into rain and snow based on output from WRF’s microphysical scheme (WRFMPP), simulations of snow depth and SWE were near equal to or better than simulations that used PRISM-derived precipitation with the calibrated partitioning method. Over all sites, WRFMPP and simulations that used PRISM-derived precipitation had relatively unbiased estimates of near-peak SWE, but both simulated absolute errors in near-peak SWE of 30\%–60\% at a few locations. Since, on average, WRFMPP had similar errors to PRISM, WRFMPP suggested a promising path forward in hydrology, as it was independent of gauge data and did not require SWE observations for calibration. Furthermore, in similar maritime environments, hydrologic modelers should pay close attention to decisions regarding rain-versus-snow partitioning, wind speed, and incoming longwave radiation.},
